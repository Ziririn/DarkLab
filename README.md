# Dark Lab (WIP)

## Description

*Dark Lab* is my 2018 graduate project. It's a game in a [survival horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_horror) genre. In many ways it follows its genre's tropes: 
* a player finds himself in a hazardous environment
* something tries to locate the player and kill him *(or not?)*
* the player explores the lab, looking for a way to escape
* the player encounters various obstacles in his search
* the player has a limited viewsight obscured by darkness

The **main feature** of the *Dark Lab* is the lab itself.
It will change its layout whenever some part of it is left beyond player's sight.
Effectively this happens whenever an area is left in the darkness, since a player can see all illuminated sectors.
