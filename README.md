# Dark Lab

**Dark Lab** is a survival horror game. In many ways it follows its genre's tropes: 
* a player finds himself in a hazardous environment;
* something tries to locate the player and kill him;
* the player explores the lab, looking for a way to escape;
* the player encounters various obstacles in his search;
* the player has a limited viewsight obscured by darkness.

The **main feature** of the **Dark Lab** is the lab itself. It will change its layout whenever some part of it is left beyond player's sight. Effectively this happens whenever an area is left unlit in the darkness.

Made with Unreal Engine 4.19.
